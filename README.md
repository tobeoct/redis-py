# Requirement Specification for Redis Server

## 1. Introduction
The Redis server is a high-performance, in-memory data structure store that serves as a key-value database, cache, and message broker. The primary goal of this Redis server is to provide fast and efficient data storage and retrieval capabilities for various applications.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Data Storage and Retrieval
- **Key-Value Store:** Support for storing and retrieving data using key-value pairs.
- **Data Types:** Support for various data types including strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, and hyperloglogs.
- **Operations:** Provide basic operations for data manipulation such as SET, GET, DEL, EXISTS, and TTL.

### 2.2 Persistence
- **Snapshotting:** Support for periodic snapshotting of the dataset to disk for persistence.
- **AOF (Append-Only File):** Optional support for appending every write operation to a log file for durability.

### 2.3 Commands
- **Command Processing:** Support for processing Redis commands including both built-in commands and custom commands.
- **Transaction Support:** Support for transactional operations using MULTI, EXEC, DISCARD, and WATCH commands.

### 2.4 Pub/Sub Messaging
- **Publish-Subscribe:** Support for publish-subscribe messaging paradigm for real-time communication between clients.
- **Channels:** Allow clients to subscribe to channels and receive messages published to those channels.

### 2.5 Replication
- **Master-Slave Replication:** Support for replication of data from a master Redis server to one or more slave Redis servers for scalability and fault tolerance.

### 2.6 Security
- **Authentication:** Support for authentication mechanisms to restrict access to the Redis server.
- **Encryption:** Optional support for data encryption to ensure confidentiality.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
- **High Throughput:** Ensure high throughput and low latency for data storage and retrieval operations.
- **Scalability:** Support horizontal scalability to handle increasing load by adding more server instances.

### 3.2 Reliability
- **Fault Tolerance:** Ensure fault tolerance and high availability through mechanisms like replication and failover.
- **Data Consistency:** Guarantee data consistency during replication and failover scenarios.

### 3.3 Security
- **Access Control:** Provide fine-grained access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data.
- **Audit Logging:** Optional support for audit logging to track user activities and detect security breaches.

### 3.4 Usability
- **Ease of Use:** Provide a simple and intuitive interface for interacting with the Redis server.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation covering installation, configuration, and usage of the Redis server.

### 3.5 Compatibility
- **Protocol Compatibility:** Ensure compatibility with the Redis protocol to allow seamless integration with existing Redis clients and libraries.
- **API Compatibility:** Provide compatibility with popular programming languages and frameworks through client libraries and drivers.

## 4. System Architecture

### 4.1 Components
- **Storage Engine:** Core component responsible for storing and managing data in memory.
- **Networking Layer:** Component responsible for handling client connections and processing Redis commands.
- **Persistence Module:** Component responsible for snapshotting and AOF log management.
- **Replication Module:** Component responsible for replicating data between master and slave servers.
- **Security Module:** Component responsible for authentication and encryption.
- **Pub/Sub Module:** Component responsible for handling publish-subscribe messaging.

### 4.2 Deployment Architecture
- **Single Instance:** Support for deploying a single Redis server instance for standalone use.
- **Cluster Deployment:** Support for deploying Redis in a cluster configuration for scalability and fault tolerance.

## 5. Performance Metrics

### 5.1 Throughput
- **Operations per Second:** Measure the number of operations (GET, SET, etc.) processed per second.

### 5.2 Latency
- **Response Time:** Measure the time taken to respond to client requests, including network latency.

### 5.3 Resource Utilization
- **Memory Usage:** Monitor memory usage to ensure efficient utilization of system resources.
- **CPU Usage:** Monitor CPU usage to ensure optimal performance under varying workloads.

## 6. Testing Requirements

### 6.1 Unit Testing
- **Coverage:** Achieve high code coverage through comprehensive unit tests for individual components.
- **Mocking:** Use mocking frameworks to isolate components and facilitate testing.

### 6.2 Integration Testing
- **Component Integration:** Test the integration of various components to ensure seamless interaction.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Conduct end-to-end testing to validate the behavior of the Redis server in real-world scenarios.

### 6.3 Performance Testing
- **Load Testing:** Conduct load testing to evaluate the performance of the Redis server under different load conditions.
- **Stress Testing:** Conduct stress testing to identify performance bottlenecks and failure points.

## 7. Documentation Requirements

### 7.1 Installation Guide
